# ESP32-based network streamer and DAC

This is my first attempt at a simple, yet high audio quality, network streamer.
Designing the schematic and PCB on KiCad 6.

Based on ESP32 (network streamer) and Texas Instruments PCM5122 DAC.

## Acknowledgements

To add ESP32 and reference PCM5122 designs that helped create this. Also -
software aspects (for network streaming and AirPlay capabilities).
